# University Management System 

This project is a University Management System built using Java and follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

# Original Project 

This prooject was originally developed by [kunaltyagi9] (https://github.com/kunaltyagi9). You can find the original repository [here] (https://github.com/kunaltyagi9/University-Management-System).

# Changes and Enhancements

I have made the following changes and enhancements to the original project :

**Feature 1:** 
### Signup Feature :
I have created a seperate sign-up class. The `Signup` class provides a user interface for creating new accounts in the university management system. It allows administrators or users to register with their username, name, password, and security question for account recovery.

**Feature 2:**
### Forgot Password Feature : 
I have created a seperate forgot-password class. The `ForgotPassword` class provides functionality for users to retrieve their password by answering security questions. It helps users regain access to their accounts in case they forget their login credentials.

**Feature 3:** 
### Home Interface :
I have created the Home class. The `Home` class serves as the main interface for navigating through different features of the university management system. It includes menus for students, teachers, examinations, and fees, allowing users to perform various administrative tasks seamlessly without login or signup.

**Feature 4:** 
## Loading Screen Feature :
I have created the loading-screen class. The `Loading` class implements a customizable loading screen with a progress bar for the University Management System application. It displays while the application initializes resources, providing a smooth user experience during startup.

**Feature 5:** 
## About Page :
The `About` class in our University Management System project displays essential information about the application and its developer. It serves as an informational page accessible within the application.
